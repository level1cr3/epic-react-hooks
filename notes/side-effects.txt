 // we can have multiple useEffect in single component. we should have them case wise?
 ex: one useEffect handles one case.

> have Everything inside the useEffect. do call function outside of it (you can but don't). 
Because then you need to lookup. if that function depends on something is that in dependencies array or not ?

ex: your doSomething depend on count value of the state. we should have that count value in dependencies array so doSomething(). get updated
value whenever it changes.

 # useEffect hook when do we need to have cleanup function? do we need it every time ?

Not every time 👍

The **cleanup function in `useEffect`** is only needed if your effect sets up something that must be torn down when the component unmounts *or* before the effect runs again.

### When you **do need** a cleanup:

* **Subscriptions / event listeners**

  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = () => console.log("resize");
    window.addEventListener("resize", handler);

    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handler);
  }, []);
  ```
* **Intervals / timeouts**

  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => console.log("tick"), 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  ```
* **WebSocket / API connection lifecycle**

  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket("wss://example.com");
    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);
  ```
* **External library init/teardown** (e.g. map, chart, drag-drop library)

### When you **don’t need** a cleanup:

* One-time API calls (just `fetch` → set state).
* Pure computations that don’t leave anything running behind.
* DOM updates that React can handle automatically.

---

👉 Rule of thumb:
Ask yourself *“Does my effect start something that keeps running after render?”*

* **Yes** → Add a cleanup.
* **No** → Skip it.

Would you like me to give you a short “decision checklist” you can quickly glance at when writing `useEffect`?







Perfect — let’s expand this 👌

When your handler depends on props/state (like `getQueryParam`), you need to make sure the **latest values** are used without re-attaching the listener on every render.

There are two main patterns:

---

## 1. **Put dependencies in `useEffect`**

If `getQueryParam` is stable (e.g. memoized with `useCallback`), you can just add it to the dependency array:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handlePopState = () => {
    setQuery(getQueryParam()); // note the call if it's a function
  };

  window.addEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);
  };
}, [getQueryParam]); // reattach if getQueryParam changes
```

This works fine if re-subscribing occasionally is not expensive.

---

## 2. **Use a ref to always access the latest function**

If you don’t want to keep attaching/removing the listener every time `getQueryParam` changes, you can store the function in a ref:

```tsx
const getQueryParamRef = useRef(getQueryParam);

// keep ref updated with latest version
useEffect(() => {
  getQueryParamRef.current = getQueryParam;
}, [getQueryParam]);

useEffect(() => {
  const handlePopState = () => {
    setQuery(getQueryParamRef.current());
  };

  window.addEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);
  };
}, []); // attach only once
```

This way:

* Listener is attached only once.
* Inside the handler, you always call the *latest* `getQueryParam`.

---

👉 Rule of thumb:

* If your dependency is stable or cheap → **option 1** (simple).
* If your dependency changes often and re-subscribing is wasteful → **option 2 with ref**.

Would you like me to show you which one is more “enterprise-grade” best practice for something like query params handling in a React/SPA router setup?
